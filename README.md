This is a terminal-based game where 2 players take turns playing cards from their deck with the goal of defeating their opponent. 
Users can choose how many rounds they want to play, which will determine the amount of cards in their deck. The game starts with both players at 100 points of health, and the one with the most health at the end of the game wins.
There are 3 types of cards that can be chosen:
A. Attack cards-- these type of cards will inflict damage to an opponent
B. Defense cards-- these type of cards will give the player defensive points, which will protect them from attacks from their opponents
C. Special cards-- players can choose to use this card type to attack, defend, or restore their own health points
Each card will be assigned a random value between 1 and 20. The cards each player recieves, as well as the value of the card, is determined through a normal distribution. [expand]
